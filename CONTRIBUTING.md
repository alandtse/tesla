# Contribution guidelines

Contributing to this project should be as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## Github is used for everything

Github is used to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've changed something, update the documentation.
3. Make sure your code lints (using black).
4. Test your contribution.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the Apache License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [Apache License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](../../issues)

GitHub issues are used to track public bugs.
Report a bug by [opening a new issue](../../issues/new/choose); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** typically have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People _love_ thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

Use [black](https://github.com/ambv/black) to make sure the code follows the style.

## Test your code modification

This custom integration is based on [integration_blueprint template](https://github.com/custom-components/integration_blueprint).

It comes with development environment in a container that is easy to launch
if you use Visual Studio Code. With this container you will have a stand alone.
Home Assistant instance running and already configured with the included
[`.devcontainer/configuration.yaml`](./.devcontainer/configuration.yaml)
file.
